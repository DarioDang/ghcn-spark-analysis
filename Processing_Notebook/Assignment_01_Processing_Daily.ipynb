However, due to the file being compressed with Gzip, the situation is different, when Spark encounters a Gzip compressed file, it must be read the entire file as a single unit without paralleizing the read operation across blocks otherwise it would lead to corrupted chunks, because Gzip does not support splitting regardless of how many HDFS blocks it spans (Apache Spark and Data Compression, n.d).

However, we can still optimize the reading and counting of observations by effectively utilizing the Spark cluster resources. The key to optimizing performance is to process as many Gzip files concurrently as possible, by using  4 executors and 2 cores per executor, we have a total of 8 cores available for task execution. This means Spark can run up to 8 tasks in parallel. Since each Gzip file is processed as a single task, we can process 8 Gzip files concurrently. According to Figure 7, Spark assigned 8 of these files to be processed in parallel across the 8 available cores at launch time 10:16:53. Once these 8 tasks complete, the remaining 2 files are processed by the same 8 cores in 10:17:09 launch time.  As a result, by ensuring that all 8 cores are fully utilized, we can reduce the overall processing time.. "
